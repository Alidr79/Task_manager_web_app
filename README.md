# Task manager web application
Using **Python + Flask + BootStrap**<br> 
**I have learned a little bit about BootStrap, so this app has a good (at least for me) UI**<br>

+ **I have also deployed this app to pythonanywhere:**<br>
  But beacause i'm using a free account and i have limited number of requests so you can't use this app without an invite code.<br>
  If I know you, send me a mail( ali.derakhshesh79@gmail.com ) and i will send an invite code for you ğŸ˜‰<br>
